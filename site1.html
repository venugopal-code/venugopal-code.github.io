        <ol style= "list-style-type: upper-roman;">
        <h3> Networking systems enhances many devices to access data or COMPUTATION power outside of the device.</h3>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>Ex: online games, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and cloud ide's, and many more</h3>

        <h2 style="text-align:center"><br>CLIENT SERVER MODEL</h3>
        <img class ="image2"src="client_server_model.png" alt = "client_server_model"><br>
        <h3> 1)SINGLE SERVER, ONE OR MORE THAN ONE CLIENTS<br></h3>
        <h3>2)SERVER PROVIDES SERVICE(REQUEST/RESPONSE) FOR CLIENTS<br></h3>
        <h3>3)SERVER MANAGES RESOURCES</h3>
        <h3>4)server responds to requests from clients</h3>
        <br>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;color:darkblue"> LOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN)</h3>
        <h3>1)LAN is a wired communication system used to transfer data within short range of distance<br>2)may be around the building
        <br>Rj45 plug in our laptop/ computer is used for this protocol</h3>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;color:darkblue"> WIDE AREA NETWORK (WAN)</h3>
        <img class ="image3"src="pics/wan.PNG" alt = "wide area network"><br>
        <h3>same as LAN but these are interconnected LAN's to increase the range of communication .
        <br> different LAN's are interconnected using switch'es. <br>
              i.e. router in your home is connected to different other routers and other devices globally to share information</h3>
        <h3>example: internet</h3>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;color:darkblue"> MANET (mobile adhoc network)</h3>
        <h3>From the name itself we could say that MANET changes its communication range from one place to other.</h3>
        <h3>Access points will be changing lets assume we're travelling with a mobile phone with us. Now its obvious that we get internet even if we're moving
        and if we swithc hotspot on , our friend access data form our mobile. so now mobile has becom a manet<br></h3>
        <h3>Ethernet is a common LAN protocol
        <br>Ethernet switch sends message to right input or output port.
        <br>HUB is used prior to SWITCH but it sends every request/response to al the ports
        <br>BRIDGE is a device that connects both SWITCHES & HUBS . BRIDGE speaks both LAN protocols</h3>
