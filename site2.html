        <h3 style ="color:black;font-size:20px;"> Anyways, every year we had a competiton between each sections of our class as we had many sections.
        just curious to find out which section is the powerful section.
        <br>so finall we had a event called KPL (KESHAVA REDDY PREMIER LEAGUE) where every section needs to play cricket in series
        of matches to win the finals and get the kpl cup to prove that we're the strongest team</h3>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;color:violet"> THE FAREWELL PARTY</h2>
        <h3 style ="color:skyblue;sont-size:25px;"> as a tradition, every year the 9th class students have to give a send off party to 10th class students as they're leaving campus after public exams.
        so every one  in the campus is allowed to bring their cameras, mobile phones and any electronic gadgets to enjoy the party
        <br>Food served will be so delicious. more than 50 items will be served. there after we take pics and enjoy the DJ party along with our TEACHERS
        <br>afer that there will be a lot of stage dramas and many culutral activities.</h3>
        <h2>after completion of farewell public exams came near and we had to study well for public examinations </h2>
        <h3 style ="color:grey;sont-size:25px;text-align:center;"><br>SCHOOL LIFE WAS SO WONDERFUL. I WISH I HAD SPENT MORE TIME IN SCHOOL.</h3>
